# Primitive Map M0-M28

This map compresses the verified M0-M28 surface into protocol primitives.

```text
Conversation is input.
Reasoning state is output.
```

A primitive is not a product feature and not a new milestone. It is a durable capability boundary already supported by docs, schema export shape, validator checks, projector state, CLI commands, fixtures, and tests.

## Append-Only Event Truth

What it does:

Stores protocol history as append-only NDJSON events. The event log is the source of truth; projected state is derived.

Milestones:

- M0 Protocol Spine Proven
- M1 Protocol Validity
- M6 Protocol Integrity
- M7 and M14 Protocol Continuity

Preserved laws:

- `.clista/events.ndjson` is source of truth.
- Projected state is derived.
- Done is not a statement. Done is a verified state.

## Deterministic Projection

What it does:

Reconstructs current reasoning state from the event log without relying on transcript memory.

Milestones:

- M0 Protocol Spine Proven
- M2 Protocol Governance
- M4 Protocol Forks
- M5 Protocol Merges
- M7 and M14 Protocol Continuity

Preserved laws:

- Projection proves memory.
- Continuity is not transcript replay.
- Many threads. Few states. One verified artifact.

## Validation Before Trust

What it does:

Rejects invalid reasoning logs before projection is treated as trusted protocol state.

Milestones:

- M1 Protocol Validity
- M2 Protocol Governance
- M6 Protocol Integrity
- M8-M25 layer-specific validation

Preserved laws:

- Validation proves protocol.
- Unsupported state is not valid state.
- Invalid reasoning must fail loudly with `event_id` and `reason`.
- Required review is pending until completed as `reviewed`.
- Recovery is verified repair, not baseline validity mutation.
- Release verification is artifact binding, not trust by existence.

## Governance And Authority

What it does:

Separates reasoning contribution from authorized state change. Decisions, merges, amendments, delegation, execution, and exchange boundaries require explicit authority context.

Milestones:

- M2 Protocol Governance
- M5 Protocol Merges
- M8 Protocol Identity
- M13 Protocol Amendments
- M18 Protocol Negotiation
- M19 and M19.1 Protocol Delegation
- M23 Protocol Review
- M24 Protocol Recovery

Preserved laws:

- Governance proves legitimacy.
- Recommendation is not amendment.
- Delegation is not authority surrender.
- Agreement is not governance merger.
- Review is not approval.
- Recovery is not history rewrite.

## Accountability: Identity, Attribution, Provenance

What it does:

Records who contributed, what role and authority context existed at event time, and what source lineage was available.

Milestones:

- M8 Protocol Identity
- M9 Protocol Attribution
- M10 Protocol Provenance
- M19.1 Delegation Actor Boundary Clarification

Preserved laws:

- Non-participant delegation is not actor exemption.
- Attribution is not reputation.
- Provenance is not truth ranking.
- Source lineage is auditability, not scoring.

## Reasoning Evolution

What it does:

Allows reasoning to branch, merge, learn, adapt, and amend without erasing dissent or rewriting prior state.

Milestones:

- M3 Decision Outcomes
- M4 Protocol Forks
- M5 Protocol Merges
- M11 Protocol Learning
- M12 Protocol Adaptation
- M13 Protocol Amendments
- M22 Protocol Learning from Outcomes

Preserved laws:

- Outcomes prove learning from consequences.
- Learning is not reputation.
- Adaptation is not governance mutation.
- Learning is not retroactive justification.

## Exchange Boundary

What it does:

Lets verified reasoning state move across contexts while preserving capability, meaning, authority boundaries, and declared exchange terms.

Milestones:

- M7 and M14 Protocol Continuity
- M15 Protocol Compatibility
- M16 Protocol Interoperability
- M17 Protocol Federation
- M18 Protocol Negotiation

Preserved laws:

- Context transfer is not memory trust.
- Compatibility is not best effort acceptance.
- Translation is not reinterpretation.
- Shared state is not shared authority.
- Agreement is not authority transfer.

## Action Chain

What it does:

Tracks an authorized action from delegation through execution, observed outcome, evaluated outcome, and learning from that evaluated outcome.

Milestones:

- M19 and M19.1 Protocol Delegation
- M20 Protocol Execution
- M21 Protocol Outcome
- M22 Protocol Learning from Outcomes

Preserved laws:

- Delegation is not authority surrender.
- Execution is not intent.
- Completion is not success.
- Learning is not retroactive justification.

Canonical fixture:

```text
examples/action-chain/events.ndjson
```

The fixture proves:

```text
delegation -> execution -> outcome -> outcome learning
```

without adding events to the canonical origin log.

## Review Routing

What it does:

Routes state changes, violations, disputes, degraded exchange signals, rollbacks, failed outcomes, inconclusive outcomes, and outcome-learning signals through required review before further action when protocol rules require review.

Milestones:

- M23 Protocol Review

Preserved laws:

- Review is not approval.
- Review completion means `reviewed`.
- Review does not approve, repair, recover, roll back, mutate governance, create authority, create consensus, assign blame, assign accountability scores, or mutate the reviewed object.

## Recovery Boundary

What it does:

Restores recovery-aware trusted projection from a verified checkpoint and append-only repair log while keeping invalid history visible.

Milestones:

- M24 Protocol Recovery

Preserved laws:

- Recovery is not history rewrite.
- Quarantine means visible but not trusted.
- Recovery verification proves restored-state claims; it does not make invalid history valid.
- Recovery does not approve, amend, create consensus, create authority, mutate governance, delete events, replace events, or perform silent repair.

## Release Boundary

What it does:

Produces and verifies a reproducible release manifest that binds package version, Git commit, Git tag, CLI entrypoint, schema hashes, source hashes, capability declarations, verifier results, and export shape.

Milestones:

- M25 Protocol Release

Preserved laws:

- Release is not trust.
- A tag is not trust.
- Publishing is not verification.
- Release does not create protocol authority, approve governance, approve amendments, prove compatibility by itself, or mutate reasoning state.
- A manifest must distinguish `release_exists` from `release_verified`.

## Runtime And Usage Boundary

What it does:

Verifies the local runtime against an existing release manifest and audits whether a fresh user can discover and execute that verification path.

Milestones:

- M26 Protocol Runtime Verification
- M26.1 Runtime Usage Audit

Preserved laws:

- Running is not verified.
- Verified runtime is not usable runtime.
- Runtime verification requires an existing release manifest.
- Runtime verification and runtime usage audit do not append events, mutate projected state, create trust, create protocol authority, approve governance, approve amendments, or prove compatibility.

## Scenario Demo Boundary

What it does:

Provides a realistic fixture replay so a fresh user can validate, project, export, and inspect durable reasoning state from documented commands.

Milestones:

- M27 Protocol Scenario / Demo Workflow
- M28 External Replay Audit

Preserved laws:

- Demo workflow is not product.
- Scenario exists is not externally reproducible scenario.
- Scenario replay is not distribution.
- Scenario replay is not artifact installation.
- Scenario replay and external replay audit do not add protocol primitives, event types, validation rules, projection behavior, export behavior, network behavior, UI, agents, trust, protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, compatibility proof, or product readiness.

## Decision Outcomes And Protocol Outcomes

M3 decision outcome means:

```text
decision reasoning consequence / declared decision result
```

It uses:

- `ExpectedOutcomeDeclared`
- `OutcomeAudited`
- `DecisionScored`
- `clista outcome expect --thread <threadId> --decision <decisionRecordId>`
- `clista outcome audit`
- `clista decision score`

M21 protocol outcome means:

```text
execution-linked observed effect evaluated against intended effect
```

It uses:

- `OutcomeExpected`
- `OutcomeObserved`
- `OutcomeEvaluated`
- `OutcomeDisputed`
- `OutcomeViolationRecorded`
- `clista outcome expect --execution <executionId>`
- `clista outcome observe`
- `clista outcome evaluate`

The names overlap because M21 reuses the CLI namespace for a narrower execution-linked outcome primitive. The event families and object shapes preserve the boundary.

## Layer Versioning And Release Versioning

Layer protocol versions mark capability boundaries. For example, delegation remains `0.19.0`, execution remains `0.20.0`, outcome remains `0.21.0`, outcome learning remains `0.22.0`, review remains `0.23.0`, and recovery is `0.24.0` until those layer behaviors change.

Package and release versions mark repository releases. A feature release can advance to `v0.28.0` while unchanged M19-M24 layer versions stay at their original capability boundaries.

M25 Protocol Release has its own `release_protocol_version: "0.25.0"` because release manifests are repository artifacts, not projected reasoning-state layers.

Use a layer version to ask:

```text
Which capability boundary introduced this projected layer?
```

Use the package or tag version to ask:

```text
Which repository release contains this cleanup, fixture, docs, or implementation?
```

## Schema And Validator Boundary

`schemas/clista-protocol.schema.json` describes exported protocol state. It intentionally leaves some projected objects open with `additionalProperties: true` so export metadata can remain forward compatible.

The strict trust contract is the validator:

```text
clista validate
```

and the layer verifiers:

```text
clista delegation verify
clista execution verify
clista outcome verify
clista outcome-learning verify
clista review verify
clista recovery verify
```

If schema permissiveness and validator strictness differ, validator strictness controls trusted protocol state.
