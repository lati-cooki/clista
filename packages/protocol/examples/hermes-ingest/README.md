# Hermes Ingestion Example

A worked example of the **agent ingestion adapter** (M30): a raw Hermes session
turned into the canonical ClisTa event log, with no hand-authoring.

Unlike the hand-built `scenario-demo`, every event here was *generated* by
`src/ingest_hermes.py` from `session.json`. The adapter is the subject of the
demonstration; the engine then validates and projects the result like any other
log.

## Files

- `session.json` — the input Hermes transcript (4 messages: a user question, an
  assistant tool call, the tool output, and an assistant recommendation that
  also names a privacy concern).
- `events.ndjson` — the generated append-only event log (10 events).
- `expected-summary.json` — the expected `decision summary` answer view, for a
  diffable replay check.

## Regenerate

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 src/ingest_hermes.py --input examples/hermes-ingest/session.json --output examples/hermes-ingest/events.ndjson
```

Ingestion is **deterministic**: object ids are derived from the session content
and timestamps come from the session's own messages, so the same input always
produces the same log, byte for byte. That makes the replay diffable — after
regenerating, `events.ndjson` is unchanged, and the answer view still matches the
committed expected output:

```sh
node src/cli.js decision summary --events examples/hermes-ingest/events.ndjson | diff - examples/hermes-ingest/expected-summary.json && echo "replay matches"
```

## Clean-room replay (one command)

To reproduce and verify the whole flow from the public files alone — copied into
a fresh temporary directory, with no dependency on local state — run:

```sh
npm run replay
```

It re-ingests the session, checks the regenerated log is byte-identical to the
committed one, validates it with the engine, confirms the answer view matches
`expected-summary.json`, and prints the human-readable summary. This is the
one-command form of the roadmap's Next Replay Observation path.

## What the adapter emits

The 4-message session maps to 10 canonical events:

| Source | Events |
| --- | --- |
| Human + agent identities | `ParticipantAdded` ×2 |
| Session | `ThreadCreated` |
| User question | `ClaimCreated` |
| Tool output | `EvidenceCommitted` |
| Named concern ("must ensure … privacy") | `ObjectionRaised` (non-blocking) |
| Assistant recommendation (evidence-backed) | `AssumptionDeclared` + `DecisionRequestOpened` + `ReviewSubmitted` + `DecisionMerged` |

See `docs/hermes-thread-emission.md` for the full mapping and extraction rules.

## Run It

From the repository root — the engine validates and projects the generated log
exactly like any hand-authored one:

```sh
node src/cli.js validate         --events examples/hermes-ingest/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js state show        --events examples/hermes-ingest/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js decision summary  --events examples/hermes-ingest/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js audit show        --events examples/hermes-ingest/events.ndjson
```

`decision summary` is the concise answer view: what was decided, why, who
dissented, and what should happen next — without reading the full state
projection. It prints JSON by default; add `--format text` (or `md`) for a
human-readable markdown rendering of the same four answers:

```sh
node src/cli.js decision summary --events examples/hermes-ingest/events.ndjson --format text
```

To trace the decision back to its source event, participant, and authority
context (the id is stable because ingestion is deterministic):

```sh
node src/cli.js provenance trace dcr_515c7c6ac3a1 --events examples/hermes-ingest/events.ndjson
```

## What It Demonstrates

A messy conversation becomes durable, reloadable, engine-verifiable state:

- the user's question is a `claim`; the tool output is `evidence`
- the assistant's privacy caveat is a recorded, non-blocking `objection`
- the recommendation is an `approved decision` that rests on the evidence and a
  named assumption, and is shown to have considered the objection
- every contribution is attributed to a source event, a participant, and an
  authority context; the audit chain is content-hash linked end to end

```text
adapter_emits_protocol != adapter_owns_protocol
```

The session is input; the engine owns protocol state. No privileged server is
required — the event log is the source of truth.
